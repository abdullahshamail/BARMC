# BARMC: Bond-Aware Moving Clusters of Atomic Trajectories with Relaxed Persistency

This repository provides the source code for the implementation of the methods described in: 

**Bond-Aware Moving Clusters of Atomic Trajectories with Relaxed Persistency** (NOTE: Submitted to ACM SIGSPATIAL 2024).

## Requirements
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn

```shell
# install all the dependencies
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

## Datasets
Presently, we only provide a small sample of the dataset used. Since the data was obtained from our collaborators working on Molecular Dynamics Simulation from other Universities - please send us a formal request via email and we will promptly respond and provide it.

## About the Code

### BARMC Detection using Naive Approach

Run the Naive Detection.ipynb

### BARMC Detection using proposed BARMC-Miner

Run the BARMC-Miner Detection.ipynb
